# Concepts

> Shared domain vocabulary for this project — entities, named processes, and status concepts with project-specific meaning. Seeded with core domain vocabulary, then accretes as ce-compound and ce-compound-refresh process learnings; direct edits are fine. Glossary only, not a spec or catch-all.

## Checking pipeline

### Typed IR

The versioned, serializable intermediate form of a checked module, in which every expression node carries an annotation.

The emitter reads only the typed IR, and the independent validator checks it, so the typed IR is the contract between the checker and every later stage.

### Annotation

The type, execution mode, and active failure and requirement sets that the checker records on each expression node of the typed IR.

The independent validator recomputes each annotation from the node's children. An annotation that copies an outside hint, such as the expected type of a binding, can differ from the recomputed value even when the program is valid.

### Independent validator

The second checker that recomputes every annotation of the typed IR without shared code with the source checker, and reports each disagreement.

It acts as a differential oracle: a program that the checker accepts and the validator rejects shows a defect in one of the two. A disagreement is repaired so that both derive the same annotation, not by weakening the validator.
_Avoid: IR checker, second pass_
